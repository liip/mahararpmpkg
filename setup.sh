In your project directory you should now have a Makefile and a changelog
file. Please verify both files and adapt the changelog if necessary then
commit both files to version control.
The changelog contains an initial entry. Make sure the all future entries
have the same format. In the changelog you should only note the differences
to the previous package. It will be added to the RPM package.
